### Create your repository

Let's create the repository you'll use for your workshop.

> [!TIP]
> Clicking on links in the instruction manual will open a browser tab on the host machine. This is fine for things like reviewing reference documents, but for the next step you'll want to interact directly with the browser in the VM.

- [ ] Locate the "Lab302" template repository for this lab.
  - Click on the **Repositories** tab on the top-nav of the page.
  - In the "Search repositories" filter text box enter `Lab302-Template`.
  - Click on the **Lab302-Template** repository in the list.
- [ ] Create your repository.
  - Click the **Use this template** > **Create a new repository** green buttons on the top-right of the page.
  - For the owner, verify (or select) **Microsoft-Build-2025**.
  - Enter a repository name that you'll use for this lab. You can accept the defaults for the rest of this form and click **Create repository**.

> [!TIP]
> You can enter any valid repository name but remember that (1) others in this environment will see your repo and you'll see theirs (2) you may need to type the repo name later.  Consider something that includes your and the lab number (e.g., "L302forDave").
