## In Conclusion

At this point you've had the chance to learn about how GitHub's native Issues and Projects mechanisms can be used to manage work. GitHub has optimized to a development team experience and not necessarily project management, meaning it isn't likely the same as your current work management tools. But many teams will find it better for their day-to-day management activities.

### Optional exercises
And while you have this playground available available and proctors to answer your questions (and don't have other demands on your time), we invite you to solify your new knowledge.  Here are some unscripted exercises you may want to try.

- Customize the project fields based on data you are likely to track.
- Add a project view to show a missing but expected data item (e.g., "Type") so that it is easy to identify and populate missing data.
- Configure [Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones) and/or [Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels). to be consistent with what you'd likely use in your daily work.
- Launch a [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/what-are-codespaces) on your repo, and use the [GH CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/index) to programatically add, view, and/or modify issue data.
