# Issue Basics

This task describes the lab steps required to complete the "Issue Basics" tasks.  As a template item, this description was filled out for you in advance (to save typing).  Generally, you will use templates to get started with a standard format and content but add additional information.  In this case, the issue is complete as-is...

To complete this task you will:
- [x] Use an issue template (done)
- [x] Review markdown used to format content in GitHub. You're looking at it now, but if you aren't already familiar with markdown you can refer to [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).  If you've already saved it and want to review the source markdown you can edit the description to see the unformatted text.
- [ ] Apply Labels
- [ ] Apply Milestones
