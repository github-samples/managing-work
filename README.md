## About this lab

This lab was created to support Microsoft Build 2025 (Lab 302) and execute within the lab environment.  That said, you should be able to run it with little-to-no changes.  One caveat - the Issue Type capabilities is only available from GitHub organizations (e.g., https://github.com/org-name) and not personal accounts (e.g., https://github.com/username).

## Getting started

To get started, leverage this repository as a **[Repository Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)** to create a repository for performing the steps.  When you create the target repo, it will automatically run a workflow to populate many of the issues that you'll need for this lab, including issue types, labels and relationships.
